# Overview

As a software engineer, I am trying to learn how to collaborate cloud database and python or any other programming language. In this repository, I will demostrate how to use Google firebase - firestore to collaborate with pyhton. 

The purpose of writing this software is to help teachers well organize his/her students' information such as student ID, student name, student contact information and student address.

Below is a YouTube video of me showing you how this code is written, and how this code works.

# Cloud Database

For this project, I am using Google Firebase - Firestore as the cloud database server. 

For the basic cloud database, I have ID, Name, Age, Contact_info, and Address set up for teachers to access.

The entire program is divided in different functions using the language of python. 

# Development Environment

* pip3 install firebase-admin
(For python to work with firebase)
* pip3 install pyrebase 
(For python to implement with user authentication)
* Python 3.9.7 64-bits 
* Visual Studio Code

# Useful Websites

* [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
* [Python functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html)
* [Firestore Query](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/get-data)


# Future Work

* Add error checkings .
* Add checking message if teacher want to check after he/she modifies any students' data.
* Collaboarte with HTML and CSS so the program shows on the webpage.
